<p align="justify">
  I am an associate lecturer in Computing at <a href="http://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/">UCLan Cyprus</a> where I teach several BSc and MSc Computing modules. 
  I have a PhD and BSc in Computing and I specialize in software engineering, cloud computing, and distributed real-time systems. 
  As part of my PhD thesis, I developed Athlos, which is a software development framework for developing scalable Massively Multiplayer Online Game backends that can run on commodity/public clouds.
  In the past, I have worked as a software developer and researcher in various projects, and I also like developing various types of software including
  web and mobile applications, cross-platform applications, software libraries, tools, and more. I have extensively experimented with programming language design, compilers,
  operating systems, clouds, robotics, and my research extends in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, Educational Robotics, Game-Based Learning, and Gamification.

<h3>Teaching</h3>

I teach several Computing modules at UCLan Cyprus:

* CO1407 - Introduction to Programming (2019-Present)
* CO1417 - Explorations in Computing (2021-Present)
* CO1111 - The Computing Challenge (2018-Present)
* CO2509 - Mobile Computing (BSc) (2023-Present)
* CO4755 - Mobile Application Development (MSc) (2022-Present)
* CO3411 - Distributed Enterprise Systems (2022-Present)

<h3>Interests:</h3>

* Software Engineering (methodologies, patterns, tools, etc.)
* Commodity clouds (development and deployment of scalable software)
* Real-time distributed systems (and specifically performance-intensive systems like MMOG backends)
* Application development (cross platform, web, Android, etc.)
* Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience
* Education in Computer Science

<h3>Some side projects</h3>

* üî• [Firestorm, an object-oriented Java API & ORM for Firebase Firestore & Real-time database](https://github.com/RayLabz/Firestorm)
* üõú [Mocha Server, a multi-threaded TCP & UDP server in Java](https://github.com/RayLabz/Mocha-Server)
* üñ•Ô∏è [nicOS, an operating system based on UNIX built from scratch](https://github.com/nkasenides/nicOS)

<h3>Current work</h3>

I am currently working on the [PREPARED Mobile app](https://prepared-project.eu/app/), which provides a digital platform to complement 
the training in terms of research ethics and integrity decision-making during global crises, under the [PREPARED project](https://prepared-project.eu/app/).

I am also working on the development of the [ePhyLi](https://www.ephyliproject.eu/) app, which aims to provide a platform for training
future PE teachers in Physical Literacy and education.

In my spare time, I work on creating ACT (Abstract Code Templates). ACT is a language (and its associated tools) that can be used to create code templates, which can be then used to generate code for a variety of languages, frameworks, environments, and purposes, with the aim of quickly and easily generating software projects for specific frameworks, creating APIs, UIs, network protocols, and more. ACT is being developed to be integrated in the Athlos framework, but to also be used as an independent tool.
