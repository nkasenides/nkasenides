<p align="justify">
  I am an associate lecturer in Computing at <a href="http://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/">UCLan Cyprus</a> and
  I specialize in Software engineering, Cloud Computing, and Distributed Real-Time systems. I have a PhD and BSc
  in Computing, and I have worked as a software developer in various projects. As part of my PhD thesis, I developed
  Athlos, which is a software development framework for developing scalable Massively Multiplayer Online Games.
  I also have significant experience in developing various types of software, including web and mobile applications, cross-platform applications,
  software libraries and tools, and I have extensively experimented with programming language design, compilers, and 
  operating systems.

<h3>Teaching</h3>

I teach several Computing modules at UCLan Cyprus:

* CO1407 - Introduction to Programming
* CO1417 - Explorations in Computing
* CO1111 - The Computing Challenge
* CO2509 - Mobile Computing (BSc)
* CO4755 - Mobile Application Development (MSc)
* CO3411 - Distributed Enterprise Systems

<h3>Interests:</h3>

* Commodity clouds (development and deployment of scalable software)
* Real-time distributed systems (and specifically performance-intensive systems like MMOG backends)
* Software Engineering (methodologies, patterns, tools, etc.)
* Application development (cross platform, web, Android, etc.)
* Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience
* Education in Computer Science

<h3>Some side projects</h3>

* üî• [Firestorm, an object-oriented Java API & ORM for Firebase Firestore & Real-time database](https://github.com/RayLabz/Firestorm)
* üõú [Mocha Server, a multi-threaded TCP & UDP server in Java](https://github.com/RayLabz/Mocha-Server)
* üñ•Ô∏è [nicOS, an operating system based on UNIX built from scratch](https://github.com/nkasenides/nicOS)

<h3>Current work</h3>

<p>
  I am currently working on the [PREPARED Mobile app](https://prepared-project.eu/app/), which provides a digital platform to complement 
  the training in terms of research ethics and integrity decision-making during global crises, under the [PREPARED project](https://prepared-project.eu/app/).
</p>

<p>
  I am also working on the development of the [ePhyLi](https://www.ephyliproject.eu/) app, which aims to provide a platform for training
  future PE teachers in Physical Literacy and education.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time, I am developing a system called Active Code Templates (ACT) and its accompanying language. ACT aims to provide
  a way for developers to define abstract code templates and use them to generate code for various purposes, technologies, environments, and programming languages,
  in order to enhance the software development process.
