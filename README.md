<p align="justify">
  I am a lecturer in Computing at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/">UCLan Cyprus</a> where I teach several BSc and MSc Computing modules. 
  I have a PhD and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/undergraduate-course/bsc-hons-computing/">BSc in Computing</a> and I specialize in software engineering, cloud computing, and distributed real-time systems. 
  As part of my PhD thesis, I extensively studied resource-demanding, real-time distributed systems such as MMOG backends,
  and developed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2674-113X/1/1/6">Athlos</a>, which is a software development framework for developing scalable Massively Multiplayer Online Game backends that can run on commodity clouds.
In the past, I have worked as a software developer and researcher in various projects, and I also like developing various types of software including
  web and mobile applications, cross-platform applications, software libraries, tools, and more. I have experimented with programming language design, compilers,
  operating systems, clouds, robotics, and my research extends in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, Educational Robotics, Game-Based Learning, and Gamification.

<h3>Some open-source side projects</h3>

üî• [Firestorm, an object-oriented data management API & ODM tool for Firebase](https://github.com/RayLabz/Firestorm)

üõú [Mocha Server, a multi-threaded TCP & UDP server in Java](https://github.com/RayLabz/Mocha-Server)

üñ•Ô∏è [nicOS, a very very (VERY) simple operating system based on UNIX built from scratch](https://github.com/nkasenides/nicOS)

<h3>Recent work</h3>

* Currently developing PwrGo, a AI-powered, context-aware task management application.

* Developed the [Firestorm](https://pub.dev/packages/firestorm) Flutter package, an objected-oriented data access API and ODM tool for Firebase's Firestore and Realtime database.

* Developed the [PREPARED Mobile app](https://prepared-project.eu/app/), which provides a digital platform to complement 
the training in terms of research ethics and integrity decision-making during global crises, under the [PREPARED project](https://prepared-project.eu/app/).

* Developed the [ePhyLi](https://www.ephyliproject.eu/) mobile app, which aims to provide a platform for training
future PE teachers in Physical Literacy and education.
