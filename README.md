<p align="justify">
  I am an associate lecturer in Computing at <a href="http://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/">UCLan Cyprus</a> where I teach several BSc and MSc Computing modules. 
  I specialize in Software engineering, Cloud Computing, and Distributed Real-Time systems and I have a PhD and BSc
  in Computing. As part of my PhD thesis, I developed Athlos, which is a software development framework for developing scalable Massively Multiplayer Online Game backends.
  In the past, I have worked as a software developer and researcher in various projects, and I also like developing various types of software including
  web and mobile applications, cross-platform applications, software libraries, tools, and more. I have extensively experimented with programming language design, compilers,
  operating systems, and robotics, and my research and activities extend in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, Educational Robotics, Game-Based Learning, Gamification, and more.

<h3>Current work</h3>

I am currently working on the [PREPARED Mobile app](https://prepared-project.eu/app/), which provides a digital platform to complement 
the training in terms of research ethics and integrity decision-making during global crises, under the [PREPARED project](https://prepared-project.eu/app/).

I am also working on the development of the [ePhyLi](https://www.ephyliproject.eu/) app, which aims to provide a platform for training
future PE teachers in Physical Literacy and education.
