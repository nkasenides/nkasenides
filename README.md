<p>
  I am an associate lecturer in Computing at <a href="http://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/">UCLan Cyprus</a> and
  I specialize in Software engineering, Cloud Computing, and Distributed Real-Time systems. I have a PhD and BSc
  in Computing, and I have worked as a software developer in various projects. As part of my PhD thesis, I developed
  Athlos, which is a software development framework for developing scalable Massively Multiplayer Online Games.
  I also have significant experience in developing various types of software, including web and mobile applications,
  software libraries and tools, and I have extensively experimented with programming language design, compilers, and 
  operating systems.
